                Salut!!! I'm <strong>Axel</strong>. Coding has change my world. <br>Tt's notjust about apps. 
                Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with 
                others on a technical level.<br> I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get
                a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>Sololearn</strong> where they build your
                self-esteem and keep you motivated.<br> Join me in this rewaeding journey. You'll have fun,
                get help, and learn along the way!
